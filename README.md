# Who am I?

I am a software developer and technical writer from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. Currently, I work as a full-stack and DevOps Engineer at [Scalar](https://scalar.io).

## Interests

I love to play the guitar, read books, and watch action movies. I also enjoy writing about technology and software development. In my free time, I like to learn new things and work on side projects.

These two other repositories include links to download ebooks I wrote back in 2015-2016 about ES6 and Machine Learning:

- [ES6](https://github.com/gacanepa/javascript-exercises)
- [Machine Learning](https://github.com/gacanepa/machine-learning-packt)

I'm also in Amazon:
